      "Hey there! I'm the creator of VivaLaLingo. This app started as a personal project — I simply wanted a better way to learn languages for myself using the Birkenbihl method.",

      "I figured, if my close circle found it useful, maybe others would too. So here we are! I've released VivaLaLingo to the world in hopes that others can benefit from this powerful language learning method just like I have.",
      "Full disclosure: this is a one-person operation. That means if I'm a little slow to implement new features, it's because it's just me behind the scenes! But I'm always working on improvements and eager to make this app the best it can be.",
